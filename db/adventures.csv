River rafting
Turkey
1
This is the final year in which it will be possible to raft the Coruh River in Turkey, because of construction of the Ispir dam. One of the world’s classic rivers for white-water rafting expeditions, the Coruh is located in dramatic mountain scenery in the north-east of Turkey, far from the Mediterranean tourist hot spots. Flowing through the heart of the Kackar mountain range, this seven-day rafting experience with Water By Nature is an adrenalin-filled roller-coaster ride negotiating grade 4-5 rapids through 1,500-metre-deep gorges and passing traditional Turkish villages.

Great Himalaya Trail
Nepal
18
This recently inaugurated trail is made up of a network of existing paths traversing Nepal. It will eventually form part of a 4,500-kilometre (2,800-mile) “super trail” linking Bhutan and Pakistan. The existing 1,700km Nepal section divides into smaller routes passing in sight of eight of the world’s 8,000-metre (26,247ft-plus) peaks and through some of the world’s most remote villages. The trail crosses mountain passes up to 6,000 metres in altitude while climbing a total of 150,000 metres.

Overland adventures
Argentina
60
For many young adventurers, overlanding is their first experience of a long journey away from home, and offers the safety of travelling in an organised group with the advantage of covering more ground than is sometimes possible in a lifetime of two-week holidays. Dragoman, the pioneer of the field, ran its first informal tour in 1981 in a Bedford truck; it now has a fleet of 24 trucks. Its 60-day tour from La Paz to Salvador da Bahia travels through Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil.

Fish River Canyon ride
Namibia
10
Ride through the world’s second largest canyon, experiencing monumental landscapes, vast desert plains and African game. These expedition rides were taken over in 2010 by Sarah Jane Gullick, who previously ran African Horseback Safaris in the Okavango Delta in Botswana, but Waldi Fritzche, who pioneered them, continues to guide a number of the northern routes. The Fish River trail reaches the canyon rim before descending and following the banks of the Orange River, and then heading across open savannah and rocky landscapes with sightings of the wild horses of the Southern Namib Desert.

Tour du Mont Blanc
France
14
This 14-day circuit of Mont Blanc is arguably the most dramatic walk in Europe. Linking the seven valleys that surround Western Europe’s highest mountain, the route crosses three borders (France/Switzerland/Italy/France), climbs over six passes, traverses beneath huge glaciers and meanders through beautiful alpine meadows and picture-book villages.Throughout the trek there are views of some of the most beautiful peaks in the Alps, including Mont Blanc (4,810m), the Aiguille Verte (4,122m), Les Drus, Les Grandes Jorasses and many more. The walking is moderate to challenging, with two rest days – but some are the equivalent of walking up and down Ben Nevis in a day.

Clearwater Paddling
Outer Hebrides
6
The popularity of kayaking as an adventure sport has increased exponentially over the last few years. At its most basic level it is an easy sport to get to grips with – anyone who is reasonably fit can master a basic stroke and learn to manoeuvre in a short time. It is also a great way of getting close to nature. Clearwater Paddling, based on the island of Barra in the Outer Hebrides, runs about 20 tours a year around Scotland – ranging from introductory courses for beginners to camping expeditions for experienced kayakers – as well as tours to farther-flung locations such as Oman and Sardinia.

Secret Apennines walk
Italy

Walking is the oldest adventure activity of them all, and exploring new landscapes on foot can feel like a genuine voyage of discovery. The secret of success lies in choosing a region which is relatively undiscovered, but which has spectacular landscapes and a rich local culture.No better example exists in Europe than the Apennine mountains stretching from Liguria to Umbria in northern Italy. The walking trails in the Corno alle Scale Regional Park lead up through forests and centuries-old mountain villages to the high mountains, where on clear days Florence’s cathedral can be seen more than 80 miles away. A seven-day self-guided walk with Inntravel staying at hand-picked family-run hotels costs from £578 including all meals, route notes and maps, and luggage transport.

Recce in the footsteps of Lord Byron
Albania
9
Joining a recce tour with all its uncertainties may not be for everyone, but for others it is the definition of adventure itself. Wild Frontiers are confident enough of the competence of their guides that each year they run a handful of new and original adventures with clients signing up as volunteers. This nine-day horse trek through the mountainous regions of southern Albania follows in the footsteps of a journey made by Lord Byron in 1809, which later became the inspiration for his poem, Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage. The route passes through the mountains of the Vjosë Valley to the castle stronghold at Tepelenë where Byron encountered the Vizier, Ali Pasha.

Pure adrenalin
New Zealand
10
Many would argue that New Zealand in general and Queenstown in particular is the adventure sports capital of the world, and its time to tick off most of the boxes. Starting with a kayaking trip along the coast of the Abel Tasman National Park, then moving on to Kaikoura on the east coast, famous for its whale and dolphin viewing. This is followed by a helicopter flight over the Franz Josef Glacier on the west coast before heading down to Queenstown itself, adventure central for adrenalin junkies. You should think about including bungee jumping from the famous Kawarau Bridge where the sport began. Then continuing to Fiordland, where scenes from The Lord of the Rings were shot, followed by Mt Cook National Park.

Everest skydive
Nepal
