Bronx Zoo
New York
3
The 4,000 odd residents who live more or less harmoniously near the Bronx River makes the Bronx Zoo the largest metropolitan zoo in the United States. Covering over 265 acres (107 ha) the parklands and habitats that make up the zoo’s naturalistic feel is a credit to the Zoo and surely kinder on the animals than some of its competitors.  The Award-winning Congo Gorilla Forest, an African rain forest that’s home to more than 20 lowland gorillas, the Jungle World, an Asian tropical rain forest that’s home to gibbons, tapir, langurs and other Asian species. If you had to live in Zoo you would have your name down for a Bronz Zoo enclosure in an instant.

The tour is good value and covers the music and some American history. Visitors see the concert hall from various points of view.

Times Square
New York
2
Theatre Square, Neon Square, or Peoples Square might be more appropriate name but Times Square, in the heart of the Theatre District, is world famous so why change a successful brand. Besides, the New York Times would not forgive us.A must see Times Square is a unique happening kind of place except,...not much really happens. The towering, animated neon signs that light up and flash are a must see but once seen you soon start to see you are in trap - a tourist trap. You can take great pictures of policeman, people and see the city light show. Times Square screams New York New York! except it’s full of visitors so the locals struggle to make it in.Tourist trap is apt as it is hard to escape through the crowds. If there was no have-to to it then you probably wouldn't. Maybe that is unfair. There are big buildings with big stores to visit, lots of pretty quick food outlets, noise, NYPD, and of course those Neon lights.

Wall Street
New York
2
Wall Street shuffles from Broadway to South Street on the East River in lower Manhattan. Wall Street is the main artery of the financial heart of New York and home to the New York Stock Exchange No. 11 and NASDAQ.When Manhattan was Dutch and liked to be known as New Amsterdam, a 2,340 foot fortified wall was erected from the East River to the Hudson River. The wall was intended to keep the British out. Today the wall is sadly gone and the British are in, in that is up to their necks in financial woe.

St. Patrick's Cathedral
New York
2
Beautiful. It is just a beautiful building both inside and out. Though Saint Patrick's was built in Gothic style, its design is original and distinct. St Pats full name is the Cathedral of Saint Patrick. You will find it located on Fifth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets in New York City. The Cathedral is the largest gothic-style Catholic Cathedral in the United States.You don't need to be Catholic to appreciate Saint Pats but you might become one if you spend too much time there. It is a truly peaceful place. A place of immense beauty in both its design and feel. Visit during day light to fully appreciate the architecture and stained glass.

Greenwich Village
New York
2
Greenwich Village is loved and famed by TV series such as Sex in the City. Beautiful tree lined streets, elegant houses, outdoor sidewalk cafés and restaurants doesn't fully explain Greenwich Village's magnetism.Maybe The Village's major appeal is more personal. If you have an interest in people you should enjoy spending time here. The cafes, restaurants and bars have made Greenwich Village a major contributor to Manhattan's social scene. At the heart of this is New York University and Washington Square Park with its Memorial Arch, street art, buskers and people watchers. The nearby Meatpacking District continues the theme but with its own brand of cafes, restaurants and nightlife.

Empire State Building
New York
2
The world's tallest buildings on completion in 1931 the Empire State still rates quite highly. Best attempted at night for great views and fewer crowds. For the better part of a century, visitors to the New York have headed directly for the Empire State Building to journey aloft to its fabled Observatory nearly a quarter of a mile above Fifth Avenue. Here you are treated to breathtaking panoramas across the rooftops, avenues and byways of the New York Metropolitan areas, to as far away as four neighboring countries...oh ok states of America but almost had you.The Empire State has had many famous visitors including King Kong and a B52 bomber. In 1945 a B-25 bomber crashed into the 79th floor. It caused little structural damage other than to the people in the plane.

Chrysler Building
New York
2
The Chrysler Building is an important and impressive New York landmark. The tower culminates in a beautiful, tapered stainless steel crown that supports the famous spire at its peak. The Chrysler Building is considered by many to be the world's quintessential skyscraper. Taller than the Eiffel Tower and briefly the tallest building in the world in 1930 (until the Empire State Building beat it into second place) The Chrysler Building remains the tallest brick building in the world and is as gorgeous as ever.Art Deco in France found its American equivalent in the design of the New York skyscrapers of the 1920s. The Chrysler Building ... was one of the most accomplished essays in the style.

Grand Central Station
New York
2
If you intend going to Grand Central Terminal to catch a train I suggest you get there early. Both a good looker, inside and out, the restored Grand Central Terminal has become much more than just a train station. Grand Central has become a midtown destination for fine restaurants, cocktail bars and specialty shops throughout. There is much to catch the eye on the giant main concourse. From the celestial ceiling mural above to the staircase modeled on the staircase at the Paris Opera. At every turn it seems there is something to admire.  Make your way downstairs towards the Oyster Bar and try the seafood. The Whispering Gallery at the either end of the Oyster Bar ramp will leave you talking to a wall quietly. Be careful not to belch if you have had too much seafood as it could be embarrassing. Discover the secret elevated passageways for fabulous views of the concourse.

Staten Island Ferry

You may get a better view from the top level of the ferry.You can avoid sharing your ferry with millions (it will seem like it) of commuters by traveling outside of peak hours. New York commuters will also appreciate it.

Broadway
New York City
3
When in New York one must see at least one Broadway Show (?) That is the mantra. Why you have to is the subject of a number of sociology studies undertaken by eminent professors around the globe. Initial results indicate watching a Broadway Show may stifle hair loss. So keep your hair on but choose wisely. Further research indicates people tend to prefer seeing a show they like. Seeing a show because you must-see one may not work for you.Seeing a show on Broadway and going to the theater in NYC is one of the most popular New York things to do. New York City offers everything from award winning new musicals like Wicked, Jersey Boys, and Mary Poppins to emotionally powerful musicals like Spring Awakening, and The Color Purple, to some of the most uplifting feel-good musicals of all time such as Mamma Mia and Hairspray.
